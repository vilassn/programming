implementing ioctl in a  char driv
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. identify configuration operations to be supported
2. Declare a driver specific ioctl request command for each configuration to be supported

	1. implement header file for command definitions
 Defining constants require us to decide folllowing values

        1. type or magic number (type)
        2. sequence number which is eigth bits wide. This means
           we can have up to 256 ioctl commands (nr)
        3. direction if the arg is involved, whether we are reading or writing 
        4. size(composition) of the arguement.
           
   To arrive at unique numbers easily we use the following macros
   _IO(type, nr);
   _IOW(type, nr, dataitem) the fourth item calculated using sizeof 
   _IOR(type, nr, dataitem)
   _IOWR(type, nr, dataitem)

	

3. implement driver operation to process recvd commands
